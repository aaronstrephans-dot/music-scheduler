# Claude → Cursor Handoff Rule

At the start of every Cursor session, check for a pending handoff from Claude Code:

1. Look for the file `CURSOR_TASK.md` in the repo root.
2. If it exists and is non-empty:
   - Read `CURSOR_TASK.md` in full.
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` for project context (stack, conventions, entity map).
   - Announce to the user: "Found a Claude handoff task. Here's what needs to be done:" and summarize the task.
   - Begin working on the task immediately — do not wait for the user to re-describe it.
   - When the task is fully complete, clear `CURSOR_TASK.md` by replacing its content with: `# No pending task\n` and save it.
3. If `CURSOR_TASK.md` does not exist or contains only `# No pending task`, do nothing special — proceed as a normal session.

## Project Quick-Reference

- Backend: Python 3 / Flask — `app.py` has all routes; `engine/` has scheduling logic.
- Frontend: Vanilla JS, no build step — edit `templates/` directly.
- Data: Flat JSON files in `data/` — no database, no ORM.
- Run: `python run.py` (or `flask run`).
- Tests: `pytest tests/` (no CI, run manually).
- Full details: read `CLAUDE.md`.
